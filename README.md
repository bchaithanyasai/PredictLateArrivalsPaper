# PredictLateArrivalsPaper
This for the research paper publication based on datasets from Bureau of Transportation Statistics and Kaggle.

Approach in brief:
We take data for two years (2015, 2019) from BTS website to analyse various factors over time in late flight arrivals such as
1) Causes for arrival delays in both years
2) Change in causes of delays over the time period
3) To see if particular airlines were more inclined to be delayed or not
4) We add weather data from Kaggle to 2015 dataset and then predict delays for both 2015 and 2019 datasets to see if weather data used had enough impact on predicting delays.
5) We visualize data to summarize various features in datasets.

Please do let me know if you find any mistakes in the notebooks as I am too data science learner. And any suggestions are also welcome!!

PLEASE DO IGNORE FILES CALLED "MODELS" and "MODELS 2019".
